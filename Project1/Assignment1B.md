## What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

### Channels
Channels are the input image on which the kernels are applied. After convolution is applied on the channels, the output generated is also called channel. That can also be said as the output channel. There can be many channels for an input image. For eg Dicom images has four channels

### Kernels 

are the matrix which are applied on the input channels
